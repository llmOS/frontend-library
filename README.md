# Frontend JS chat widget

### Running locally
```
npm install
npm run build
```
Open test.html in browser


### How it works

- We run "npm run build"

    - Everything from "src" directory gets compiled to a single minified .js file
- User imports the .js file and runs OpenCopilot.initialize(...) in their frontend

Check test.html for an example
